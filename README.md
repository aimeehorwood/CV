👉 Hi there, I’m Aimee :wave:,  I’m an ambitious and proactive junior software engineer and graduate of Makers Academy. 

👉 I'm the sort of person who looks up the ending of a film before it's finished. I'm unapologetically curious and like asking the big questions - *I don't just need to know why and how it works, but also how it can be better?* 

👉 I used to work as a political and communications strategist consulting some of the UK's biggest technology and consumer businesses, now I am using my problem-solving, team-work, communication, and strategic thinking skills to break down problems, fix bugs and deliver full stack applications using JavaScript, React, Node.js, Ruby and Sinatra.

👉 I am ready to utilise OOP, TDD, paired programming, and agile methodologies to a role where I can feed my curiosity and write high quality code to build programs that truly matter

## Skills

#### Communication

- My background in communications has provided me with excellent communication skills.  Whilst working for the world’s largest gambling company, an integral part of my role was communicating technical concepts to stakeholders that had different levels of technical knowledge, such as charities, regulatory bodies, journalists, and Members of Parliament. 

- One these concepts, was an algorithm to detect harmful patterns of play to aid customer interventions. After meeting the team that created the algorithm, I created briefing papers and sound-bites that were then used in Government submissions, inquiries and future external meetings. As a result, this helped our wider stakeholder environment to understand the product and company objectives better.  

- At Makers, I have had to rely on my communications skills to understand and explain technical concepts when working on group projects and pairing throughout the course.

#### Analytical thinking and problem solving 

- I have always been a great problem solver and analytical thinker, from as young as I can remember I used to dissemble my toys and put them back together to understand how they worked.  

- Whilst working a strategist and consultant, one my FinTech clients were engaged in a lengthy Government review to further regulate their product.  Using my problem solving and analytical skills, I scoped out a two month project to conduct polling to better understand if negative coverage of the product was aligned with audiences from different parts of the country.  My presumption was correct, which allowed the company to use the results of the polling to curb negative criticism and protect their interests.  

- I have since applied the same analytical thinking and problem solving skills to my time training to become a software engineer. At Makers, I have had to break down problems and bugs, test my own theories using research and data in order to resolve them.

#### Working under pressure 

- This is a skill I have developed throughout my career, as politics and the news cycle changes very quickly.  As a strategist and consultant, I had to continuously ensure that deadlines were met by my team, and that our work was delivered to a high standard.

- At Makers through group projects, I’ve learnt agile methodologies to break down work into smaller tasks through sprints and delegating tickets to ensure that group work is delivered on time.

#### Proactivity

- I consider myself to be someone who just gets ‘things done’.  I was the first from my graduate scheme cohort to be promoted to a full time role.  In my first few months I brought myself up to speed on existing projects and presented a new engagement strategy with our key audiences based upon an initiative that my manager was unaware of in the company. 

- I also added value to the culture of the company by getting involved in charity projects and organising a charity boat race for my colleagues on Hammersmith river which raised £13,000 for two local charities.  Recently my proactive approach can be seen by choosing to pursuing a career change to software engineering.

**Flutter Entertainment** (2016 to 2021) _owner of Betfair, PaddyPower, SkyBetting & Gaming and PokerStars_
